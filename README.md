# Multiple Linear Regression

-> This project demonstrates the implementation of **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** — a key supervised learning technique that models the relationship between multiple independent            variables and one dependent variable.


## Objective:-
-> To understand and implement Multiple Linear Regression from both **mathematical** and **practical** perspectives, analyzing how multiple predictors affect the target.


## Libraries Used:-

-> numpy 
-> pandas
-> matplotlib
-> seaborn
->LinearRegression
-> mean_absolute_error
-> mean_squared_error
-> r2_score
